HTML element有两种展示方式 ： block(占一整行) 和 inline（不占一整行）

There are two display values: block and inline
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary
The <div> element is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document

span element像div一样，区别在于它是 inline container
